I must use two forms of birth control for at least one month before I start isotretinoin therapy. I must receive counseling, repeated on a monthly basis, about birth control and behaviors associated with an increased risk of pregnancy • have signed an Informed Consent For Patients Who Can Get Pregnant (for patients who can get pregnant) that contains warnings about the chance of possible birth defects if I am pregnant or becoming pregnant and my unborn baby is exposed to isotretinoin • have been informed of and understand the purpose and importance of providing information to the iPLEDGE REMS should I become pregnant while taking isotretinoin or within 1 month of the last dose • have interacted with the iPLEDGE REMS before starting isotretinoin and on a monthly basis to answer questions on the program requirements and to enter my two chosen forms of birth control",
